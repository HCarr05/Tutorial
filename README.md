# How to Build a Computer
### Holdyn Carr
This tutorial will go through the steps of building a computer. It will include how to know what parts to get along with the actual process of building one.  
This tutorial i meant for people who are new to buidling computers and need a easy to understand tutroial on what they need to do.

# Finding the right parts.
There are a lot of reasons to want to build a computer and there are many diffrent factors that play into what you need to buy. Things like what you are going to use the computer for, How big your budget is etc. The first thing to take into account is what you are going to be doing. The most common answers to this quesstion is either gaming or content creation. 
Now that you have what you are going to be using the computer for down I would recommend going to this website [PCPartPicker](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/). This is a great website to easily find parts and whats also nice about this site is that any part you put in there it will check and make sure it is compatiable with the rest of your build. Make sure you look at the motherboard and CPU and make sure they are compatiable CPU and motherboards will have numbers and letters like LGA 1200 this is a way to identify which CPUs fit with what motherboards.

# Parts have shipped
Once you get all of your parts shipped in and have the tools required to build the computer your first going to want to lay out everything on a table. Open both the front and back pannels on your case ![Front of Case](https://pisces.bbystatic.com/image2/BestBuy_US/images/products/6522/6522034cv12d.jpg;maxHeight=2000;maxWidth=2000;format=webp)

Once you have these removed you can begin to unbox the mother board. Take the motherboard out and lay it down on top of the box you took it out of. Unlatch the CPU housing and prepare it to slot the CPU in

The Grey square that is in the middle of the board is what we are looking at now. This is where the CPU is stored.![CPU](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/53366612939_4a328f5233_o.jpg)  
The CPU is the brain of the cpmputer and the process of putting the CPU in the Motherboard is delicate. The CPU has pins on the back of it that are very easy to bend so grab your CPU by the sides and slowly lower it into the CPU housing. There is an arrow in one of the corners of the CPU then there should be an arrow on the Motherboard too these arrows align and thats how you know youve aligned the CPU corectly. The CPU should just slide into place then you can bring the latch back down on the housing to secure your CPU in place. This will require an uncomfotable amount of pressure but dont worry as long as you got the cpu in corectly then it will be fine.  
Once the CPU is in place put the motherboard in the case and screw it in there will be screws to use that come with the motherboard or case.
After the motherboard is secured in the case prepare the board to put the ram in. You should use the second and fourth slot from left for the fastest speeds.

Depending on what cooler you got will depend on how you install it. although I would recomend an AIO (All in one) Theses coolers bring really good temps to your CPU and are very easy to install.

Next install any case fans you bought but some cases come with fans preinstalled so make sure you check before you buy and fans.  
Find where the M.2 Slot is and put yours in the slot.
At this point you should be ready to install the GPU the GPU is the main part for a lot builds especially gaming builds.![GPU](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/New-GPU-featured.jpg)  
There is a slot called the PCIE slot just bellow the M.2 Slots this is where the GPU will go. there are also brackets on the side that you need to remove for the GPU to fit.  
At this point you should have everything connceted to the motherboard and now is time to put the Power supply in its place and connect everyhting to it. ![Power Supply](https://pisces.bbystatic.com/image2/BestBuy_US/images/products/6459/6459246_sd.jpg)  
The power supply will come with all the cables you need and all the cabels will be labeld to where they plug into on the PSU and the motherboard making it easy to what goes where.  
Once you have everything connected you can finally flip the switch on the PSU and plug it in and boot the PC once it is on you will need a flash drive with windows installed on it for the computer to actually be usable then set up an account and you are good to go. You will need a working computer or laptop to install windows onto the flash drive or you can just buy flash drives online that have windowns on them although be careful who you buy them from and only buy from trusted sellers.
I hope this tutorial was helpful Thank you for letting my Tutorial be the one you read.
